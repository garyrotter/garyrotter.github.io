My name is Gary Rotter and I have been working in the Film & TV industry since 2015. I've decided to leave Tinseltown behind and begin a career in cybersecurity. I look forward to the rewarding and complex work that lies ahead and my contribution to it. From my direct experience in management, logistics, confidentiality, and fast paced ad-hoc problem solving coupled with my anaylitical skills I come with a diverse background and strong work ethic. 

Everyday I strive to learn a little more whether it be python, cybersecurity frameworks and tools, advancements in tech and AI, current state of threats to the security industry, and how to become more well rounded as a human being. I also enjoy film photography, plant-based cooking, spending time with my wife and dog, and finding new hobbies. I'm so old school, I wrote all of this without chatGPT.

## CERTS

I am currently working on my SEC+
